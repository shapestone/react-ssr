Server Side Rendered (SSR) React
================================

## Overview
I found myself in the need of an SSR implementation supporting React.js.
There are many versions online for React.js implementations, however I
found most of them to be overly complicated for what I needed.
This is my version of the most simple setup that I was able to find and
 modify. It's based on: https://youtu.be/LfA2XDmgVbo

My requirements were:
  - React: 16.8.6
  - React hooks support
